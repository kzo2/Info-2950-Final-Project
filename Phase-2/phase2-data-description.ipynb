    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<em> **What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?** </em> <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For the data analysis, three datasets were created: playlists.csv, tracks_list_unfiltered.csv, and tracks.csv.\n",
    "In the playlists.csv data set, each observation (row) represents a unique playlist created by a user of Spotify's platform. In particular, each playlist in the data set has the word \"quarantine\" in either the title or the description of the playlist. Each playlist also has a number of (attributes) that describe it. The first attribute is the name, listing the name the user entered for the playlist. The total attribute displays the number of songs in each playlist, and the URI attribute prints Spotify's unique playlist URI for that example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, tracks_list_unflitered.csv was created using playlists.csv using the processes explained below. In this new dataset, each observation represents a song that was contained in one of the playlists in playlists.csv, while there are many attributes for each song. First, the URI of each song is listed, followed by the release date of each song, and then several audio features, including popularity, explicit, danceability, and key, each of which is assigned to a numeric value. The only exception to this is the explicit attribute, to which a boolean value of True or False is assigned to each song. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, tracks.csv was created in the same format as tracks_list_unfilitered.csv with one significant change. Each song that was a duplicate in tracks_list_unfiltered was removed, leaving unique songs. The observations and attributes of this final data set are otherwise identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<em> **Why was this dataset created?**</em>  <br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This dataset was created to measure the effect that COVID-19 quarantine has had on people's music choices. Further, by analyzing the specific characteristics of the songs extracted, we will illustrate how this quarantine has affected the mental well-being of everyday people. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<em> **Who funded the creation of the dataset?** </em> <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Spotify is an audio streaming platform that provides easy access to over 50 million tracks. Users can browse the platform, filtering by artist, album, or genre, as well as create unique playlists to complement their music taste. Individuals who create an account on Spotify (and potentially purchase Spotify premium for unlimited free downloads) agree to share their listening data with the public. That data is used to improve algorithms that offer music recommendations to users, but also provides an opportunity for research on user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, the creation of this dataset was made possible by Spotify's Web API, through which web developers can access catalog data for the creation of apps, software, websites, and more. Spotify funded the Web API to facilitate better use of its platform by third-party developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through the Spotify Web API, external applications retrieve Spotify content like playlists and specific song data. In order to access user-related data through Spotify's API, an application must be authorized by the user to access that particular information. Create a simple server-side application that accesses user-related data through the Spotify Web API. Using the Spotify Developer Platform, audio features from tracks can be calculated. For example, a song's valence, beats per second (bps), and even danceability. Spotify's Developer API allows coders to read calculated audio features of tracks to learn about its danceability, energy, valence, and more. For more advanced use cases, it is possible to read in-depth analysis data about tracks such as the segments, bars, beats, pitches, and more.\n",

    "<em>**What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**</em> <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There are various processes along each step of our data collection that influenced what data was observed and recorded, and what was not. The first factor is whether or not a Spotify user's playlist was public or not. We only collected data on public playlists. The next is the process we used to differentiate \"quarantine playlists\" from non-quarantine playlists. We decided to filter playlists based off of their title and playlist description. If either of these contained the word \"quarantine,\" then we recorded it. However, this process could have been altered by changing the term to \"Coronavirus\" or \"COVID.\" Due to the pure scope of the number of data points, this would flood our dataset. We decided to narrow down our search to only one term: \"Quarantine.\" We could have also filtered playlists by country if we only wanted to look at quarantine playlists in the United States. Another process that influenced data observation was the search limitations on Spotify. Spotify only lets users receive two thousand results per search with Spotify API. This limited the number of data points we could record and analyze. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**</em> <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The preprocessing that Spotify did before we even began data scraping was pairing each playlist and each song with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Every object has its own URI: users, songs, playlists, artists, albums, episodes. The relevant preprocessing for us was that Spotify matches each URI with the playlist name, and within each playlist unit, lists each track, and the relevant data for that track. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we used Spotify API to collect all public playlists with the term \"quarantine\" in either their title or in their description. The search for \"quarantine\"-containing playlists gave us 289,213 playlists. However, Spotify's API only lets us extract data at a rate limitation of two thousand results per search. This meant we could only access a subset of the entire dataset, thus meaning our data collection was of a sample of data, rather than all data on Spotify's \"quarantine\"-containing playlists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon scraping Spotify for a playlist containing \"quarantine,\" we extracted the playlist name, the total number of tracks, and its URI. We put this data in playlists.csv. Then, using the URI of each playlist, we used a Spotipy function called playlist_tracks() to extract the URI's of the individual track in a \"quarantine\" playlist. Then, we created a data frame with the results of playlist_tracks(), called tracks, and created the datafile tracks_list_unfiltered.csv with this data. However, this tracklist is unfiltered because it only had the track URI and the count or the number of different times it appeared in playlists (i.e., how many different \"quarantine\" playlists it was in). We then cut out any songs that appeared less than 4 times (i.e., appeared in less than 4 distinct playlists), reducing the track count from 130,806 to 8,944 songs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we had the list of raw track data, we worked to make the data usable, informative, and insightful. We created a function called filter_data(), which used the Spotipy function track() to access the name, popularity, release date, and explicitness of each song. We also used Spotipy's audio_features() function to access then the tracks' audio features, which include variables like \"danceability,\" \"energy,\" \"key,\" and \"loudness.\" Our function filter_data() thus turned each track URI into a slew of exciting values for each of these track variables, giving us valuable information and available metrics for our data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>**If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**</em> <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Speaking from personal experience, when users use Spotify to stream music, thoughts, and concerns surrounding their data and its privacy rarely surface. Users see Spotify as purely a music streaming app, a place where they can find relaxation, joy, emotional release. People see Spotify for what it provides -- music. Rarely do they stop to consider how their behavior is tracked or how their data is stashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the notion that Spotify is paying attention to you is on the peripheral. Spotify makes it clear that it cares about you, through its curation of \"Discover Weekly\" playlists made just for you, through its live stream of what the people you follow are listening to, through the ways it recommends additional songs for you to listen when you finish the last song in a playlist. Like most popular applications today, Spotify tracks user data to understand what its users enjoy so that it can provide more of it. It is transparent, albeit easy-to-overlook, that Spotify is collecting data on users. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, users are unaware of the data collection process and precisely what data is being collected. If we had never done this project, we would have never learned the metrics Spotify uses to understand my music taste. Now we know that it's based on variables like valence, tempo, popularity, danceability, etc. We would have never known that anyone with a Spotify account can see my public playlists and the tracks in each playlist; or, even eerier, what the last song we listened to was. We knew our followers would view my song streaming, but never stopped to think that since anyone can follow us, anyone can access our streaming history. Users of Spotify are aware of the data collection process -- they have to be, as it is built into Spotify's most enjoyable and exciting features. However, in today's society, users are so accustomed to curated worlds shaped by variations of media being fed to users through an infinite feed of recommendations by machine-learning AI. We have become numb to our data being collected and reflected back to us, and with Spotify, as with many other popular apps, most users do not stop to think about the reasons, the methods, and the people behind its data collection.\n",

    "<h3> Potential Problems with Dataset </h3> <br>\n",
    "The dataset that we will be focusing on is track_list.csv. One problem with this dataset is the categorical variables in the set, such as “explicit”, “mode”,  and “type.” These could provide difficulty during our analysis when comparing the categorical variables with the numerical variables.\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>**Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).**</em> <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Technically, our raw data source is the Spotify music streaming application. We used Spotipy to scrape Spotify for playlist and track data. We created a variety of data sets, two of them being the \"raw data,\" and the final one is what we will use for our analysis. The two \"raw data\" sets are track_list_unfiltered.csv and playlists.csv. The finalized dataset is track_list.csv.\n",
